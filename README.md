# Walk-In-Clinic

- To help clinics to track and follow up on patientsâ€™ information more easily
- created a GUI using Java Swing for user interaction and connected with the back end using REST API
- Applied OOP principles and Observer pattern in order to make the connections between the objects of doctors and patients more transparent while avoiding tight coupling between the two objects
